I chose to use as much bootstrap as possible throughout my website in order to maximise the portability.
On each page I chose to place a picture banner with the page heading displayed over it. For my colour choices, I wanted to have a few different colours but nothing too unorthodox so I used RGB.
To implement the map on the home page I took a screenshot of the map area that I wanted to display and edited it to mark out aberdeen on the map.
For navigation, I made use of bootstrap's tabs. This made it easy to implement and also allowed me to be sure that the website will scale well.

Some challenges I faced included implementing the widgets on the visit.html page as well as ensuring that all of my information was displayed clearly for the reader. I was able to overcome the problems I faced by reviewing my lecture notes and playing around with the code.
