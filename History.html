                <h4>Granite</h4>
                <p>Due to the massive amount of granite that was present in the North East of Scotland, Aberdeen became the world trade hub for granite by the end of the 19th century. A vast quantity of granite was taken from the Rubislaw Quarry, which is one of the largest man made holes in Europe! (shown below).</p>
